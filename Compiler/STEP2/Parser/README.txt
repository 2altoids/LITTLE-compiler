Submission structure:
	1: Main.java is the Driver class;
	2: CustomToken.java is additional class that must be 
	   included to the project, just in case if you want 
	   to compile on your computer;
	3: MicroParser.java is the Parser that must be 
	   included to the project, just in case if you want 
	   to compile on your computer;
	4: MicroGrammar.g4 is ANTLR4 grammar file for the Micro language;
	5: Parser.jar is the Java executable program;
	   5.1: Parser.jar includes Main.java, CustomToken.java, MicroParser.java and 
	        all files which were generated by ANTLR tool;
			
EXTRA:
	1: Micro.sh: 
	   To run it in Windows --> .\Micro.sh file_name.micro
	   To run it in Linux --> ./Micro.sh file_name.micro
	   It will run Parser.jar file and provide an argument for it
	   *** Partially works in Linux ***
	
    2: Micro2.sh:
	   To run it in Windows --> .\Micro.sh file_name.micro
	   To run it in Linux --> ./Micro.sh file_name.micro
	   It will generate and compile all classes and will provide an argument for it
	   *** Partially works in Linux ***

How to run Micro.jar in Windows:
	1: java -jar Parser.jar file_name.micro
	2: file_name.micro must be in the same directory

Here is YouTube video that shows how it is working, just in case
